 -     --- Added patient registration date to record         -- This will make sure no retrospective documents will get added         or at least we add documents since registration in case new clinical codes are added         to existing aliases
 -     --- Added push notification upon appointment cancellation     --- Fixed style issue on add notification page
 -     --- Added push notification on appointment change         -- time change must be greater than an hour         -- modified an existing notification code to use this functionality         -- changed notification type column to use serial instead of id for proper linking

 -     --- Fixed missing template reference after restruction
 -     --- Redesigned template and controller structures         -- removed all instances of script injections on html pages and made it its own html template.         Eg: a template was injected for edit post on the post.html. Now it's its own template in edit.post.html         -- same goes with the controllers. Now every "edit" and "delete" functionality has its own controller         -- see directory tree for design but basically each feature has its own directory (alias, post, questionnaire, etc)         -- Now, edits, deletes, adds are fully separated

 -     --- Added user logging for diagnosis translation         -- Modifications on this content is recorded in the database by who and session
 -     --- Added logging of logins and logouts         -- Now each login and logout is recorded in the database with a sessionid     --- Added change logs for Alias events         -- Now changes to the alias pages are recorded in the database with a sessionid and         user who changed the entity
 -     --- Added more sophisticated session logging         -- Session id now made per login in the backend (attached to user)         -- In cookies for now, but will log sessions in database
 -     --- Same fix as previous commit
 -     --- Added missing requires of the Encrypt service
 -     --- Added password encryption between frontend/backend communication         -- All passwords are now encrypted before firing a POST request to the backend so that         passwords are illegible even if someone tries to look at request data
 -     --- Included bowerrc to bypass SSL signing for bower installs     --- updated htaccess with some added security         -- Note that directory listing is already implemented

 - Merge branch 'frequencyFeature' into develop
 -     --- Added appointment status filter to new legacy questionnaire page
 -     --- Removed "repeat once" option from frequency filter         -- By default, it will only publish once so it's redundant     --- Added conditional logic for recurring filters         -- If appointment, status, checkin, or frequency filters are defined,         it will flag to check if the questionnaire has been published today (to         publish according to recurring schedule, but no more than once a day). If not,         it will check it has been published for all time (to publish only once forever).
 -     --- Trigger update on changing repeat interval
 -     --- Reverted auto-increment optimization in commit: 66ed1b5f961799023b7085c71461a5ea3629791b         -- Turns out auto-increment still augments even after update         (See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23516958/on-duplicate-key-auto-increment-issue-mysql)         -- Optimized by removing FrequencyEventsSerNum in database since it will never be used.         Only metas set will display in table instead of the '*' wildcard for unused meta keys         -- Reverted scripts that were manipulating '*' wildcards
 -     --- Fixed crash on settings when switching from custom freuqncy to preset frequency
 -     --- Optimized frequency filter         -- To avoid auto increment primary key to potentially increase to a very large number         after every update to the legacy questionnaire (because it would delete everything         and put the new settings in the FrequencyEvents table), all settings are "flushed"         (i.e. all metas are wildcarded '*') and new settings are updated in the database.         This avoids having new FrequencyEventsSerNum values for every update.         This is a tradeoff between having low FrequencyEventsSerNum values with 9 static allocated         rows and potentially high FrequencyEventsSerNum with allocated rows corresponding to the         settings made (min:0, max:5 rows)         -- MetaKey's now have a pipe delimeter to identify the type of meta key and associate the         metakey to the corresponding legacy questionnaire (note the 'lqc' = LegacyQuestionnaireControl         -> underscore serial number of the legacy questionnaire control)
 -     --- Finished publisher logic for frequency filter     --- Will optimize metas
 -     --- Fixed crashes     --- Almost completed the publisher of legacy questionnaires based on frequency filters
 -     --- Started publisher logic for frequency filter         -- Will retrieve loegacy questionnaires that fall under the defined frequency intervals

 -     --- Able to retrieve frequency settings from the database
 -     --- Testing
 -     --- Further developments to filter
 -     --- Added frequency interval for publishing legacy questionnaires
 - Merge branch 'release-0.15.0.0' into develop

Version 0.15.0.0:
 -     --- Fixed failed publishing issue         -- When more than one patient filter is defined, the logic would fail to see an         existance of a patient in the filter list even though it is there. Marked down as         a coding error. Changed logic to check if it does exist. The else contains the next statement.
 -     --- Added checkin and appointment status filters to legacy questionnaires
 -     --- Fixed bug where save changes button didn't enable when updating a filter     --- Changed publisher to use alias appointment filters instead of aria expressions

So some educational materials where         inappropriately sent to patients.

My guess is that this happened during the virtualization of the Aria database servers.         Had to increase the max length in order to get the rest of the image hex.
